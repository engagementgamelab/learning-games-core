# learning-games-core
Common functionality for the Engagement Lab's socket-based learning games. These games currently include [Emerging Citizens](https://github.com/engagementgamelab/emerging-citizens) and [@Stake v3.0](https://github.com/engagementgamelab/at-stake-v3). More functionality will be added in the future as we strive for a more micro-service architecture in tandem w/ our flexible [Web Suite](https://github.com/engagementgamelab/EL-Website) project.
